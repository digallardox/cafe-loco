## Project Description

Cafe Loco is an application that takes a database of different types of Coffee and renders it onto the screen. Through the application, users can add new coffee to the database and vote on their favorites. The voting function will count & display the total number of votes and order the coffee accordingly. The submitted coffee will also be instantly rendered on the application for users to see.
